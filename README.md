## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üîê Secure Registration:** Only a designated admin account (representing a transport authority) can register new vehicles.
* **üë§ Owner-Controlled Transfers:** Only the current, cryptographically-verified owner of a vehicle can initiate an ownership transfer.
* **üßæ Public Verifiability:** Anyone can enter a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to view the car's details and confirm its current owner.
* **‚õìÔ∏è On-Chain Integrity:** All registration and ownership data is stored on the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof and permanent audit trail.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend (Smart Contract)
* **Blockchain:** Ethereum (simulated locally with Ganache)
* **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
* **Development Framework:** Brownie (Python-based)
* **Testing & Deployment:** Web3.py, Pytest

### Frontend (DApp)
* **UI Library:** React
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Blockchain Interaction:** Ethers.js
* **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask

## üìÇ Project Structure

This project is a monorepo containing both the backend and frontend in a single repository.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **Python:** Version 3.10+ ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* **Node.js:** Version 18+ ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
* **Ganache:** A personal blockchain for local development ([Download Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/))
* **MetaMask:** A browser extension wallet ([Download MetaMask](https://metamask.io/))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-vehicle-registration.git](https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-vehicle-registration.git)
    cd blockchain-vehicle-registration
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend folder
    cd python-vehicle-registry

    # Install Brownie if you haven't already
    pipx install eth-brownie

    # Compile the smart contracts
    brownie compile
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend folder from the root directory
    cd ../frontend-new

    # Install npm packages
    npm install
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Start the Local Blockchain:**
    * Launch the Ganache desktop application.
    * Click on **"Quickstart Ethereum"**.

2.  **Deploy the Smart Contract:**
    * Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory (`python-vehicle-registry`).
    * Run the deployment script:
        ```bash
        brownie run scripts/deploy.py --network ganache-local
        ```
    * **Important:** Copy the new contract address that is printed in the console.

3.  **Update the Frontend Config:**
    * Open the frontend project (`frontend-new`) in your code editor.
    * Navigate to `src/App.jsx`.
    * Paste the new contract address into the `contractAddress` variable.

4.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    * In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory (`frontend-new`).
    * Run the development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * Open your browser and go to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

5.  **Configure MetaMask:**
    * Add Ganache as a custom network (`RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:7545`, `Chain ID: 1337`).
    * Import accounts from Ganache into MetaMask using their private keys to act as the Admin and different vehicle owners.
